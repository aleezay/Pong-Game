# Pong Game

A basic pong game using SVGs. Two players face off using the paddles to control the ball and score points.

## Stretch Goals

When a player scores a point their paddle grows and their opponents paddle shrinks.
The game ends when the paddle is too small to play.

(The game pauses at the end but I am working on adding a final winner declaration and a reset to continue playing).

## Keys
