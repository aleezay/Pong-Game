# Pong Game

A basic pong game using SVGs. Two players face off using the paddles to control the ball and score points.

## Stretch Goals

When a player scores a point their paddle grows and their opponents paddle shrinks.
The game ends when the paddle is too small to play.
Pressing the r key resets the game.
The game pauses at the end and an alert box pops up, declaring the winner.

(I am working on adding an animated final winner declaration and a reset to continue playing).
